# Getting Started with AWS Direct Connect<a name="getting_started"></a>

AWS Direct Connect enables you to directly interface your on\-premises network with a device at an AWS Direct Connect location\.

AWS Direct Connect supports these port speeds over single\-mode fiber: 1 Gbps: 1000BASE\-LX \(1310nm\) and 10 Gbps: 10GBASE\-LR \(1310nm\)\.

You can set up an AWS Direct Connect connection in one of the following ways\.


| Port speed | Method | 
| --- | --- | 
|  1 Gbps or higher  |  Connect directly to an AWS device from your router at an AWS Direct Connect location\.  | 
|  1 Gbps or higher  |  Work with a partner in the [AWS Partner Network](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners) or a network provider to connect a router from your data center, office, or colocation environment to an AWS Direct Connect location\. The network provider does not have to be a member of the APN to connect you\.  | 
|  Less than 1 Gbps  |  Work with a partner in the [AWS Partner Network](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners) who can create a hosted connection for you\. Sign up for AWS and then follow the instructions to [accept your hosted connection](#get-started-accept-hosted-connection)\.  | 

The following procedures demonstrate the common scenarios to get set up with an AWS Direct Connect connection\. Alternatively, you can refer to the article [How do I provision an AWS Direct Connect connection?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/provision-direct-connection/) in the Knowledge Center\.

## Prerequisites<a name="get-started-prerequisites"></a>

For connections to AWS Direct Connect with port speeds of 1 Gbps or higher, ensure that your network meets the following requirements:
+ Your network must use single\-mode fiber with a 1000BASE\-LX \(1310nm\) transceiver for 1 gigabit Ethernet or a 10GBASE\-LR \(1310nm\) transceiver for 10 gigabit Ethernet\.
+ Auto\-negotiation for the port must be disabled\. Port speed and full\-duplex mode must be configured manually\.
+ 802\.1Q VLAN encapsulation must be supported across the entire connection, including intermediate devices\.
+ Your device must support Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) and BGP MD5 authentication\.
+ \(Optional\) You can configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection \(BFD\) on your network\. Asynchronous BFD is automatically enabled for AWS Direct Connect virtual interfaces, but does not take effect until you configure it on your router\.

## Step 1: Sign Up for AWS<a name="get-started-signup"></a>

To use AWS Direct Connect, you need an AWS account if you don't already have one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose **Sign\-in using root account credentials**\. Then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad\.

## Step 2: Request an AWS Direct Connect Connection<a name="ConnectionRequest"></a>

For connections of 1 Gbps or higher, you can submit a connection request using the AWS Direct Connect console\. Ensure that you have the following information:
+ The port speed that you require\. You cannot change the port speed after you've created the connection request\. 
+ The AWS Direct Connect location at which the connection is to be terminated\.

If you require a port speed less than 1 Gbps, you cannot request a connection using the console\. Instead, contact an APN partner, who can create a hosted connection for you, which you then accept\. Skip the following procedure and go to [\(Less than 1 Gbps Only\) Accept Your Hosted Connection](#get-started-accept-hosted-connection)\.

**To create a new AWS Direct Connect connection**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. In the navigation bar, select the Region for the connection\.

1. On the **Welcome to AWS Direct Connect** screen, choose **Get Started with Direct Connect**\.

1. In the **Create a Connection** dialog box, do the following:

   1. For **Connection Name**, type a name for the connection\.

   1. For **LAG Association**, specify whether the connection is standalone, or if it should be associated with a link aggregation group \(LAG\) in your account\. This option is only available if you have a LAG in your account\. To associate the connection with a LAG, select the LAG ID\. The connection is created with the same port speed and location as specified in the LAG\. For more information, see [Link Aggregation Groups](lags.md)\.

   1. For **Location**, select the appropriate AWS Direct Connect location\.

   1. If applicable, for **Sub Location**, choose the floor closest to you or your network provider\. This option is only available if the location has meet\-me rooms \(MMRs\) in multiple floors of the building\.

   1. Select the appropriate port speed, and then choose **Create**\.

It can take up to 72 hours for AWS to review your request and provision a port for your connection\. During this time, you may receive an email with a request for more information about your use case or the specified location\. The email is sent to the email address that you used when you signed up for AWS\. You must respond within 7 days or the connection is deleted\.

For more information, see [AWS Direct Connect Connections](WorkingWithConnections.md)\.

### \(Less than 1 Gbps Only\) Accept Your Hosted Connection<a name="get-started-accept-hosted-connection"></a>

If you requested a connection of less than 1 Gbps from your selected partner, they create a hosted connection for you \(you cannot create it yourself\)\. You must accept it in the AWS Direct Connect console before you can create a virtual interface\.

**To accept a hosted connection**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. If necessary, select the Region in which the hosted connection resides\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Connections**\.

1. Select the hosted connection\.

1. Select the confirmation check box and choose **Accept Connection**\.

1. Go to [Step 4](#createvirtualinterface) to continue setting up your AWS Direct Connect connection\.

## Step 3: Download the LOA\-CFA<a name="DedicatedConnection"></a>

After you request a connection, AWS makes a Letter of Authorization and Connecting Facility Assignment \(LOA\-CFA\) available to you to download, or emails you with a request for more information\. The LOA\-CFA is the authorization to connect to AWS, and is required by the colocation provider or your network provider to establish the cross\-network connection \(cross\-connect\)\.

**To download the LOA\-CFA**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Connections**\.

1. Select the connection and choose **Actions**, **Download LOA\-CFA**\.
**Note**  
If the link is not enabled, the LOA\-CFA is not yet available for you to download\. Check your email for a request for more information\. If it's still unavailable, or you haven't received an email after 72 hours, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase)\.

1. Optionally type the name of your provider to have it to appear with your company name as the requester in the LOA\-CFA\. Choose **Download**\. The LOA\-CFA is downloaded to your computer as a PDF file\.

1. After you've downloaded the LOA\-CFA, do one of the following:
   + If you're working with an APN member or network provider, send them the LOA\-CFA so that they can order a cross\-connect for you at the AWS Direct Connect location\. If they cannot order the cross\-connect for you, you can [contact the colocation provider](Colocation.md) directly\.
   + If you have equipment at the AWS Direct Connect location, contact the colocation provider to request a cross\-network connection\. You must be a customer of the colocation provider\. You must also present them with the LOA\-CFA that authorizes the connection to the AWS router, as well as the necessary information to connect to your network\.

AWS Direct Connect locations that are listed as multiple sites \(for example, Equinix DC1\-DC6 & DC10\-DC11\) are set up as a campus\. If your or your network providerâ€™s equipment is located in any of these sites, you can request a cross connect to your assigned port even if it resides in a different campus building\. 

**Important**  
A campus is treated as a single AWS Direct Connect location\. To achieve high availability, configure connections to different AWS Direct Connect locations\.

If you or your network partner experience issues establishing a physical connection, see [Troubleshooting Layer 1 \(Physical\) Issues](Troubleshooting.md#ts_layer_1)\.

## Step 4: Create a Virtual Interface<a name="createvirtualinterface"></a>

To begin using your AWS Direct Connect connection, you must create a virtual interface\. You can create a private virtual interface to connect to your VPC\. Or, you can create a public virtual interface to connect to public AWS services that aren't in a VPC\. When you create a private virtual interface to a VPC, you need a private virtual interface for each VPC to which to connect\. For example, you need three private virtual interfaces to connect to three VPCs\.

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following information:
+ **Connection**: The AWS Direct Connect connection or link aggregation group \(LAG\) for which you are creating the virtual interface\.
+ **Virtual interface name**: A name for the virtual interface\.
+ **Virtual interface owner**: If you're creating the virtual interface for another account, you need the AWS account ID of the other account\.
+ \(Private virtual interface only\) **Connection to**: For connecting to a VPC in the same region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC\. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway\. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN\. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN\. For more information, see [Create a Virtual Private Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/SetUpVPNConnections.html#vpn-create-vpg) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway\. For more information, see [Direct Connect Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways.html)\.
+ **VLAN**: A unique virtual local area network \(VLAN\) tag that's not already in use on your connection\. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802\.1Q standard\. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection\.
+ **Address family**: Whether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6\.
+ **Peer IP addresses**: A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each \(dual\-stack\)\. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface\. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session\.
  + IPv4:
    + \(Public virtual interface only\) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own\.
    + \(Private virtual interface only\) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you\. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only \(for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network\)\.
  + IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR\. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses\.
+ **BGP information**:
  + A public or private Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) Autonomous System Number \(ASN\) for your side of the BGP session\. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it\. If you are using a private ASN, it must be in the 64512 to 65535 range\. Autonomous System \(AS\) prepending does not work if you use a private ASN for a public virtual interface\.
  + An MD5 BGP authentication key\. You can provide your own, or you can let Amazon generate one for you\.
+ \(Public virtual interface only\) **Prefixes you want to advertise**: Public IPv4 routes or IPv6 routes to advertise over BGP\. You must advertise at least one prefix using BGP, up to a maximum of 1,000 prefixes\.
  + IPv4: The IPv4 CIDR must not overlap with another public IPv4 CIDR announced using AWS Direct Connect\. If you do not own public IPv4 addresses, your network provider might be able to provide you with a public IPv4 CIDR\. If not, [contact AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase) to request a public IPv4 CIDR \(and provide a use case in your request\)\.
  + IPv6: Specify a prefix length of /64 or shorter\.
+ \(Private virtual interface only\) **Jumbo frames**: The maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) of packets over AWS Direct Connect\. The default is 1500\. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 \(jumbo frames\) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames\. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds\. To check whether a connection or virtual interface supports jumbo frames, select it in the AWS Direct Connect console and find **Jumbo Frame Capable** on the **Summary** tab\.

AWS requests additional information from you if your public prefixes or ASNs belong to an ISP or network carrier\. This can be a document using an official company letterhead or an email from the company's domain name verifying that the network prefix/ASN may be used by you\.

When you create a public virtual interface, it can take up to 72 hours for AWS to review and approve your request\.

**To provision a public virtual interface to non\-VPC services**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Connections**\.

1. Select the connection and choose **Actions**, **Create Virtual Interface**\.

1. Choose **Public**\.

1. For **Virtual Interface Name**, type a name for the virtual interface\.

1. For **Virtual Interface Owner**, choose **My AWS Account** if the virtual interface is for your AWS account\.

1. For **VLAN**, type the ID number for your virtual local area network \(VLAN\)\.

1. \[IPv4\] To configure an IPv4 BGP peer, do the following:

   1. Choose **IPv4**\.

   1. For **Your router peer IP**, type the IPv4 CIDR destination address to which Amazon should send traffic\.

   1. For **Amazon router peer IP**, type the IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to AWS\.

   \[IPv6\] To configure an IPv6 BGP peer, choose **IPv6**\. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses\. You cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses\.

1. For **BGP ASN**, type the Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) Autonomous System Number \(ASN\) of your gateway\.

   To have AWS generate a BGP key, select **Auto\-generate BGP key**\.

   To provide your own BGP key, clear **Auto\-generate BGP key**\. For **BGP Authentication Key**, type your BGP MD5 key\.

1. For **Prefixes you want to advertise**, type the IPv4 CIDR destination addresses \(separated by commas\) to which traffic should be routed over the virtual interface\.

1. Choose **Continue**\.

**To provision a private virtual interface to a VPC**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Connections**\.

1. Select the connection and choose **Actions**, **Create Virtual Interface**\.

1. Choose **Private**\.

1. For **Virtual Interface Name**, type a name for the virtual interface\.

1. For **Connection To**, choose **Virtual Private Gateway** and select the virtual private gateway\.

1. For **VLAN**, type the ID number for your virtual local area network \(VLAN\)\.

1. \[IPv4\] To configure an IPv4 BGP peer, choose **IPv4** and do one of the following:
   + To have AWS generate your router IP address and Amazon IP address, select **Auto\-generate peer IPs**\.
   + To specify these IP addresses yourself, clear **Auto\-generate peer IPs**\. For **Your router peer IP**, type the destination IPv4 CIDR address to which Amazon should send traffic\. For **Amazon router peer IP**, type the IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to AWS\.

   \[IPv6\] To configure an IPv6 BGP peer, choose **IPv6**\. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses\. You cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses\.

1. For **BGP ASN**, type the Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) Autonomous System Number \(ASN\) of your gateway\.

   To have AWS generate a BGP key, select **Auto\-generate BGP key**\.

   To provide your own BGP key, clear **Auto\-generate BGP key**\. For **BGP Authentication Key**, type your BGP MD5 key\.

1. To change the maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) from 1500 \(default\) to 9001 \(jumbo frames\), select **Jumbo MTU \(MTU size 9001\)**\.

1. Choose **Continue**\.

If you use the VPC wizard to create a VPC, route propagation is automatically enabled for you\. With route propagation, routes are automatically populated to the route tables in your VPC\. If you choose, you can disable route propagation\. For more information, see [Enable Route Propagation in Your Route Table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/SetUpVPNConnections.html#vpn-configure-routing) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## Step 5: Download the Router Configuration<a name="routerconfig"></a>

After you have created a virtual interface for your AWS Direct Connect connection, you can download the router configuration file\. The file contains the necessary commands to configure your router for use with your private or public virtual interface\.

**To download a router configuration**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Virtual Interfaces**\.

1. Select the virtual interface and then choose **Actions**, **Download Router Configuration**\.

1. For **Download Router Configuration**, do the following:

   1. For **Vendor**, select the manufacturer of your router\.

   1. For **Platform**, select the model of your router\.

   1. For **Software**, select the software version for your router\.

1. Choose **Download**, and then use the appropriate configuration for your router to ensure that you can connect to AWS Direct Connect\.

For example configuration files, see [Example Router Configuration Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/create-vif.html#vif-example-router-files)\.

After you configure your router, the status of the virtual interface goes to `UP`\. If the virtual interface remains down and you cannot ping the AWS Direct Connect device's peer IP address, see [Troubleshooting Layer 2 \(Data Link\) Issues](Troubleshooting.md#ts-layer-2)\. If you can ping the peer IP address, see [Troubleshooting Layer 3/4 \(Network/Transport\) Issues](Troubleshooting.md#ts-layer-3)\. If the BGP peering session is established but you cannot route traffic, see [Troubleshooting Routing Issues](Troubleshooting.md#ts-routing)\.

## Step 6: Verify Your Virtual Interface<a name="connected"></a>

After you have established virtual interfaces to the AWS Cloud or to Amazon VPC, you can verify your AWS Direct Connect connection using the following procedures\. 

**To verify your virtual interface connection to the AWS Cloud**
+ Run `traceroute` and verify that the AWS Direct Connect identifier is in the network trace\.

**To verify your virtual interface connection to Amazon VPC**

1. Using a pingable AMI, such as an Amazon Linux AMI, launch an EC2 instance into the VPC that is attached to your virtual private gateway\. The Amazon Linux AMIs are available in the **Quick Start** tab when you use the instance launch wizard in the Amazon EC2 console\. For more information, see [Launch an Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-instance_linux.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.* Ensure that the security group that's associated with the instance includes a rule permitting inbound ICMP traffic \(for the ping request\)\.

1. After the instance is running, get its private IPv4 address \(for example, 10\.0\.0\.4\)\. The Amazon EC2 console displays the address as part of the instance details\.

1. Ping the private IPv4 address and get a response\.

## \(Optional\) Configure Redundant Connections<a name="RedundantConnections"></a>

To provide for failover, we recommend that you request and configure two dedicated connections to AWS, as shown in the following figure\. These connections can terminate on one or two routers in your network\.

![\[Redundant connection diagram\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/images/redundant_connection.png)

There are different configuration choices available when you provision two dedicated connections:
+ Active/Active \(BGP multipath\)\. This is the default configuration, where both connections are active\. AWS Direct Connect supports multipathing to multiple virtual interfaces within the same location, and traffic is load\-shared between interfaces based on flow\. If one connection becomes unavailable, all traffic is routed through the other connection\.
+ Active/Passive \(failover\)\. One connection is handling traffic, and the other is on standby\. If the active connection becomes unavailable, all traffic is routed through the passive connection\. You need to prepend the AS path to the routes on one of your links for that to be the passive link\.

How you configure the connections doesn't affect redundancy, but it does affect the policies that determine how your data is routed over both connections\. We recommend that you configure both connections as active\.

If you use a VPN connection for redundancy, ensure that you implement a health check and failover mechanism, and check your [route table routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/SetUpVPNConnections.html#vpn-configure-routing)\.

To achieve high availability, we strongly recommend that you configure connections to different AWS Direct Connect locations\. For more information about high availability options, see [Multiple Data Center HA Network Connectivity](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-multiple-data-center-ha-network-connectivity/)\.
