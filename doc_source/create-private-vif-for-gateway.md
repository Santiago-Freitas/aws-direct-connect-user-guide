# Creating a Private Virtual Interface to the Direct Connect Gateway<a name="create-private-vif-for-gateway"></a>

To connect your AWS Direct Connect connection to the remote VPC, you must create a private virtual interface for your connection\. Specify the Direct Connect gateway to which to connect\.

**Note**  
If you're accepting a hosted private virtual interface, you can associate it with a Direct Connect gateway in your account\. For more information, see [Accepting a Hosted Virtual Interface](accepthostedvirtualinterface.md)\.

**To provision a private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Virtual Interfaces**\.

1. Choose **Create virtual interface**\.

1. Under **Virtual interface type**, for **Type**, choose **Private**\.

1. Under **Virtual interface type**, choose **Private**\.

1. Under **Private virtual interface settings**, do the following:

   1. For **Virtual interface name**, enter a name for the virtual interface\.

   1. For **Connection**, choose the Direct Connect connection that you want to use for this interface\.

   1. For **Virtual interface owner**, choose **My AWS account** if the virtual interface is for your AWS account\. 

   1. For **Gateway type**, choose **Direct Connect gateway**\.

   1.  For **Direct Connect gateway**, select the Direct Connect gateway\.

   1. For **VLAN**, enter the ID number for your virtual local area network \(VLAN\)\. 

   1. For **BGP ASN**, enter the Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) Autonomous System Number \(ASN\) of your gateway\.

1. Under **Additional Settings**, do the following:

   1. To configure an IPv4 BGP or an IPv6 peer, do the following:

      \[IPv4\] To configure an IPv4 BGP peer, choose **IPv4** and do one of the following:
      + To specify these IP addresses yourself, for **Your router peer ip**, enter the destination IPv4 CIDR address to which Amazon should send traffic\. 
      + For **Amazon router peer ip**, enter the IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to AWS\.

      \[IPv6\] To configure an IPv6 BGP peer, choose **IPv6**\. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses\. You cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses\.

   1. To advertise prefixes to Amazon, for **Prefixes you want to advertise**, enter the IPv4 CIDR destination addresses \(separated by commas\) to which traffic should be routed over the virtual interface\. 

   1. To change the maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) from 1500 \(default\) to 9001 \(jumbo frames\), select **Jumbo MTU \(MTU size 9001\)**\.

1. Choose **Create virtual interface**\.

After you've created the virtual interface, you can download the router configuration for your device\. For more information, see [Downloading the Router Configuration File](create-vif.md#vif-router-config)\.
