# Disassociating a Connection From a LAG<a name="disassociate-connection-from-lag"></a>

You can disassociate a connection from a LAG to convert it to a standalone connection\. You cannot disassociate a connection if this will cause the LAG to fall below its threshold for minimum number of operational connections\.

Disassociating a connection from a LAG does not automatically disassociate any virtual interfaces\. You must associate the virtual interface with the connection separately\. For more information, see [Associating a Virtual Interface with a Connection or LAG](associate-vif.md)\.

**Important**  
Connectivity to AWS over the connection is interrupted during disassociation\.
