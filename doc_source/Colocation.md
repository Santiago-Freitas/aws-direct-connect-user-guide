# Requesting Cross Connects at AWS Direct Connect Locations<a name="Colocation"></a>

After you have downloaded your Letter of Authorization and Connecting Facility Assignment \(LOA\-CFA\), you need to complete your cross\-network connection, also known as a *cross connect*\. If you already have equipment located in an AWS Direct Connect location, contact the appropriate provider to complete the cross connect\. For specific instructions for each provider, see the table below\. Contact your provider for cross connect pricing\. After the cross connect is established, you can create the virtual interfaces using the AWS Direct Connect console\.

Some locations are set up as a campus\. For more information, see [AWS Direct Connect Locations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/details/#AWS_Direct_Connect_Locations)\.

If you do not already have equipment located in an AWS Direct Connect location, you can work with one of the partners in the AWS Partner Network \(APN\) to help you to connect to an AWS Direct Connect location\. For a list of partners in the APN with experience connecting to AWS Direct Connect, see [APN Partners supporting AWS Direct Connect](http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners/)\. You need to share the LOA\-CFA with your selected provider to facilitate your cross connect request\.

An AWS Direct Connect connection can provide access to resources in other regions\. For more information, see [Accessing a Remote AWS Region](remote_regions.md)\.

**Note**  
If the cross connect is not completed within 90 days, the authority granted by the LOA\-CFA expires\. To renew a LOA\-CFA that has expired, you can download it again from the AWS Direct Connect console\. For more information, see [Downloading the LOA\-CFA](create-connection.md#create-connection-loa-cfa)\.
